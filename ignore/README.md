## Description

A back end CLI application for a retail internet company. Using _Express.js_ and _Sequelize_, __E-Comm__ a company can open a database with test data and use _Insomnia Core_ to verify the application works. The database can then be altered to the user's needs, such that they can post, update, or delete items easily.  
  
This application was written to meet or exceed the guidelines laid out in the provided [User Story](#User%20Story) and [Acceptance Criteria](#Acceptance%20Criteria).
